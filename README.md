# Useful Bash Scripts üéõÔ∏è

As I first learned scripting, I searched for scripting use cases outside of the DevOps field, but was unable to find many. This motivated me to share my own bash/zsh scripts in this repository, with the hope of that it will help others to automate some tasks in their terminal for other than DevOps Workloads which translates to **Personal Workload** :) enjoy.






### Scripts descriptions 

* In the [AlgoTradNotebook](AlgoTradNotebook) I converted three lines of commands into one which is the execute command `./script_name.sh` in Unix based systems.  Here's what the script does: it echoes that the script it is running, creates a Python environment, changes directory to the desired location of the environment, and then opens Jupyter notebook. This is automation at its best! Isn't that amazing? üòÇ.

* The [play around scripts](/play_around_scripts) file is scripts that I wrote while learning from [Chuck Keith](https://twitter.com/networkchuck) in his [youtube bash course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhvC56v63IKioClkSNDjW7iz-6TFvLwS).
