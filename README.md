# Useful bash\zsh Scripts 🎛️

## What?
As I first learned scripting, I searched for scripting use cases outside of the DevOps field, but was unable to find many. This motivated me to share my own bash/zsh scripts in this repository, with the hope of that it will help others to automate some tasks in their terminal for other than DevOps work loads which translates to "Personal Workload" :) enjoy 💙.






### Scripts descriptions 

* In the [AlgoTradNotebook](AlgoTradNotebook) I converted three lines of commands into one which is the execute command `./script_name.sh` in Linux. This is automation at its best! 😃 Here's what the script does: it echoes that the script is running, creates a Python environment, changes directory to the desired location, and then opens Jupyter notebook. Isn't that amazing? 😂

* The [play around scripts](/play_around_scripts) file is scripts that I wrote while learning from [Chuck Keith](https://twitter.com/networkchuck) in his [youtube bash course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhvC56v63IKioClkSNDjW7iz-6TFvLwS)
